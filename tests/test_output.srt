1
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:23,881
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:27,466
We haven't been properly
introduced. I'm Leoben.

3
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:30,094
I'm looking forward to spending a
little more time with you, Starbuck.

4
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,304
We have a lot to talk about!

5
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,347
It's gonna be fun.

6
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:35,392
Congratulations, Commander.

7
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:39,729
The Pegasus is your command.

8
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:43,149
Hey, I am picking up
a large planetary body.

9
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:47,529
It's habitable. We may have just found
a world that can support human life.

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,906
I know in my gut that
settling on this planet's

11
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:51,783
gonna mean disaster
for humanity,

12
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:54,493
and I will not say otherwise
just to win an election.

13
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:57,456
I take the office of President
of the 12 Colonies of Kobol.

14
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,875
And I am going to sign
my first executive order

15
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,460
requiring to immediately
establish settlements

16
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,673
on the planet we have come
to know as New Caprica.

17
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:09,134
If you want to move down
there, go ahead, be my guest.

18
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,510
Go down and cat around
with all the men.

19
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:13,930
Saul, I want you.

20
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:18,932
At last, a safe haven
we can call home.

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,481
Oh, my Gods!

22
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,317
The Cylon fleet, they found us.

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,736
We have to get out
of here, sir.

24
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:30,030
We can't just leave
all those people behind.

25
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,156
There's nothing we can do.

26
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:33,158
We're in no shape
for a fight, sir.

27
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,534
They'll be wiped out.

28
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:35,786
We don't have a choice.

29
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:38,037
We need to get out
of here right now!

30
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:41,667
Begin jump prep. We're leaving.

31
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,793
But we'll be back.

32
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:44,543
The Cylons just
jumped into orbit.

33
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:47,923
And the fleet's jumped away.
They've left us.

34
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:52,552
On behalf of the
people of the 12 Colonies,

35
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,805
I surrender.

36
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:59,805
I'm looking for Kara Thrace.

37
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:11,913
Do you know that every time
they take you out of this cell,

38
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:15,922
we come in here and we change
those little hashmarks

39
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:18,425
on your little calendar there
you're trying to hide?

40
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,930
Potatoes, gravy,
even some carrots.

41
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,461
Heavenly Father, we thank you
for the bounty of this table.

42
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:56,838
Yes.

43
00:05:57,964 --> 00:06:00,300
Yes.

44
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,593
Come on, don't stop.

45
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:07,139
Come on, come on,
you son of a bitch!

46
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,891
You son of a bitch!

47
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:12,728
Oh, yeah.

48
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:26,826
Oh, boy.

49
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:39,463
All right, we're armed.

50
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:44,464
They're inbound. Let's move!

51
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:09,615
I need a knife.

52
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:29,096
Thank you.

53
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:34,098
You're welcome.

54
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:44,528
I must say,
I quite enjoyed that.

55
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:49,529
I'm so glad.

56
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,329
And when do I get what I want?

57
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:59,084
I believe that's happening
right now.

58
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:11,430
We reviewed your case today,

59
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:16,432
and I must say there was great
disappointment on the review committee.

60
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:46,758
Come on.

61
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,635
We've got to get you processed.
It'll take an hour or so.

62
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:52,429
Bureaucracy must be served.

63
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,100
But if you're lucky, you'll
get home by dinnertime.

64
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,604
Colonel, come on.

65
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:04,605
I'm not gonna hold
this door open forever.

66
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:16,620
Attention, New Capricans.
Effective immediately, a pot of water

67
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:20,375
will be given to residents in
even-numbered pods on even-numbered days

68
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:25,375
and odd-numbered pods on odd-numbered days.
Rationing will be...

69
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:26,965
Saul!

70
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,432
Oh, sweetheart.
What did they do to you?

71
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:41,433
It's all right. I'm out,
and that's all that matters.

72
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:50,779
Come on, now,
let's get out of here.

73
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,280
Okay.

74
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:13,591
Okay, ready? Now!

75
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,557
Oh, for frak sakes.
Come on! Come on!

76
00:10:17,557 --> 00:10:22,557
Is that thing gonna work
or what?

77
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:30,857
It worked that time.
Come on. Go, go!

78
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:38,908
Frakking insurgents.

79
00:10:57,972 --> 00:11:02,972
You look so lovely tonight.

80
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:39,009
I'll see you soon, Kara.

81
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:43,308
Take your time.

82
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:12,356
"One hundred

"on a day when it feels
like perpetual war

87
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:27,496
"is the only realistic
prospect for us.

00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:31,500
"We've had no contact with Galactica
since it left four months ago.

"But I refuse to believe

90
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,216

"But in order for the insurgency

96
00:13:57,443 --> 00:14:00,113
"we need to strike
a high-profile target.

97
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:05,076
"It is simply not enough to kill
Cylons, because they don't die.

"They resurrect themselves, and
they continue to walk among us.

99
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:12,457
"It is horrifying.

00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:17,458
"The Cylon Occupation Authority

"over the city,

103
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:27,639
"functions in name only."

104
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,684
Let's review why we're here,
shall we?

105
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:34,312
We're supposed to bring the word
of God to the people, right?

106
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:36,606
To save humanity from damnation

107
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:39,652
by bringing the love of God to
these poor benighted people.

108
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:41,611
We're here because
the majority of the Cylon

109
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:44,615
felt that the slaughter of
mankind had been a mistake.

110
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,783
We're here to find a new
way to live in peace,

111
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:48,326
as God wants us to live.

112
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:50,120
And it's been a fun ride
so far.

113
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,664
But I want to clarify
our objectives.

114
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,082
If we're bringing
the word of God,

115
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,375
then it follows

116
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,211
that we should employ any
means necessary to do so.

117
00:14:58,212 --> 00:14:59,589
Any means. Yes.

118
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,716
Fear is a key article
of faith, as I understand it.

119
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:05,677
So perhaps it's time to
instill a little more fear

120
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:08,722
into the people's
hearts and minds.

121
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:12,851
Let's execute Baltar.

122
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:17,398
What, what?

123
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,607
That's not gonna happen.

124
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,442
Just because
he's your favorite toy

125
00:15:20,443 --> 00:15:23,361
shouldn't be allowed to interfere
with the larger issues here.

126
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:24,947
I think that
I have cooperated...

127
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:26,783
Gaius is with me.

128
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:30,702
Anyone who wants to challenge
that will have to deal with me.

129
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:31,995
No, it doesn't matter.

130
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,414
If we'd killed him at the
beginning, it might have worked.

131
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,333
But now most humans
think of him as a traitor

132
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,793
and would actually
cheer his death.

133
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:41,004
Fine, fine.
We don't kill Baltar.

134
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:45,134
We round up the leaders of the insurgency,
and we execute them publicly.

135
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:47,345
We round up, at random,
groups off the street,

136
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,221
and we execute them publicly.

137
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:52,099
Send a message that the
gloves are coming off.

138
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,812
The insurgency stops now or else we
start reducing the human population

139
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:58,730
to a more manageable size.

140
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:01,192
I don't know,
say less than 1,000.

141
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,735
We need to stop being butchers.

142
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:07,322
The entire point of coming here
was to start a new way of life,

143
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:10,993
to push past the conflict that
separated us from humans for so long.

144
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:12,828
And what has it gotten us?

145
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,831
It's not like
they welcomed us with...

146
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:19,585
Oh, frak it, never mind. You're
all living in a fantasy world.

147
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:21,044
Consider the irony in that!

148
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,840
Delusional machines.

149
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:28,841
What's the universe
gonna come up with next?

150
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:35,684
Is it really worth it, Caprica?

151
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:39,772
Is the love of that man really
worth possibly losing all of this?

152
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,024
If you ever experienced love,

153
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:47,024
you wouldn't have to ask.

154
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:55,288
"In recent months, the Cylons
have been recruiting and training humans

00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:05,523
"to fight the Cylons."

174
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:10,525
"They have everything to lose and such
little hope of something to gain."

175
00:18:12,406 --> 00:18:17,406
Hey, Jake.

176
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:52,238
There we go.

177
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,743
It looks like Mommy's gonna get
some sleep tonight after all.

178
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:07,877
You know, sometimes I hate
everything about this place.

179
00:19:07,878 --> 00:19:12,878
But sometimes it's magic.

180
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:23,932
I gotta go. Be back
in a couple hours.

181
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:32,028
One of these days you're just
not gonna come back, are you?

182
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:35,114
You'll just vanish,
and that'll be it.

183
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:38,116
I'll never see you again.

184
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:43,117
Nick will never know
his father.

185
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:50,584
A couple hours, promise.

186
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,924
Good to see you, Colonel.

187
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:40,925
It's good to be seen.

188
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,938
I know you're wondering,
so I'll save you the trouble.

189
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:51,065
The eye is gone.

190
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,900
Ripped it right out,
onto the floor,

191
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,443
picked it up
and showed it to me.

192
00:20:55,444 --> 00:21:00,444
It looked like
a hardboiled egg.

193
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:05,913
Big boom today.

194
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:07,038
Hope that was you two.

195
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,541
Oh, yeah. A heavy Raider, too.

196
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:12,586
Good man.
What's our next target?

197
00:21:12,586 --> 00:21:14,462
Well, we got these today.

198
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:16,339
They're security plans
for the graduation ceremony

199
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,717
of the New Caprica
Police Academy.

200
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:20,553
These are right out
of the Ministry files.

201
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:21,679
Where are you getting
this stuff?

202
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,012
Who's your source?

203
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:26,432
I have no idea. The source won't
tell me what their name is.

204
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:28,227
It's probably safer
for all of us.

205
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:30,061
We've been getting
stuff like this for weeks.

206
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:33,440
Humans working for the Cylons,
makes me wanna puke.

207
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:36,734
Yeah, well, all of the top Occupation
brass is gonna be at the graduation,

208
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:39,821
even President Baltar.

209
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:41,198
Gaius Baltar?

210
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,282
Yes, sir.

211
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:43,741
I think we can get
a shot at him, too.

212
00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:46,202
The problem is, it's gonna be
tough avoiding human casualties.

213
00:21:46,203 --> 00:21:48,580
Don't avoid them!
Send a message.

214
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,915
You work with the Cylons,
you're a target.

215
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:54,170
No boundaries for the Cylons,
there's no boundaries for us!

216
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:59,171
Anything we can do to nail that son of
a bitch, Gaius Baltar, is worth doing.

217
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:08,099
Where are we on the wireless?

218
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:11,478
Nowhere. Every day we try
and contact the Raptor,

219
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:14,690
and every day the Cylons
jam the transmission.

220
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:16,692
I've asked the inside source
to tell us

221
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:18,986
which of the Cylon jamming
frequencies are the weakest,

222
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:20,362
but so far I've got nothing.

223
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:24,782
You guys are dreaming. There's
no Raptor there, okay?

224
00:22:24,784 --> 00:22:28,369
There hasn't been one for the
past four months, either.

225
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:32,333
Galactica's not coming back.
They're not.

226
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:35,544
Accept it. You watch
your frakking mouth!

227
00:22:35,545 --> 00:22:38,881
There's a Raptor out there every day,
listening for our wireless call.

228
00:22:38,882 --> 00:22:42,425
It's out there because that was
the plan if anything happened.

229
00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:46,763
And it's out there because the old man
isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons!

230
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,849
The old man left me
to the Cylons, Colonel.

231
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:52,978
And if it wasn't for my wife
being a royal pain in the ass

232
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:54,355
and refusing to let it go,

233
00:22:54,355 --> 00:22:59,355
I would be dead a year now.

234
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:11,413
Any word on Kara?

235
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:16,413
Nothing in four months.

236
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:35,186
Hi, honey. I'm home.

237
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:43,569
You kill me, I download,

238
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,074
I come back, we start over.

239
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:52,075
Five times now.

240
00:24:04,174 --> 00:24:07,135
I'm trying to help you, Kara.

241
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:10,221
I only want you to see
the truth of your life,

242
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:13,017
the reason why you suffered and
you struggled for so long.

243
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,727
That's why God sent me to you.

244
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:18,939
That's why God wants us
to be together.

245
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,109
You're right.

246
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:25,528
You're right.

247
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:27,071
And I hear you. I do.

248
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:29,782
Okay.

249
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:34,784
So, thank you.

250
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,671
Thank you
for putting up with me.

251
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:43,756
I'm so sorry.

252
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:48,757
Put it down, Kara.

253
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:55,555
Just put it down.

254
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:02,231
I'm a patient man.

255
00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:03,442
You're not a man.

256
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:06,111
I'm willing to wait.
You just need more time.

257
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:10,156
I don't need more frakking time.
It's never gonna happen.

258
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:12,910
Of course it's gonna happen.
You're gonna hold me in your arms.

259
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:17,122
You're gonna embrace me. You're
gonna tell me that you love me.

260
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:20,334
I've seen it.

261
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,169
You're insane.

262
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:27,170
To know the face of God
is to know madness.

263
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:35,098
I'm going to bed.

264
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:40,099
Be nice if you joined me.

265
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,359
Either way, you're spending
the night with me.

266
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:59,330
I do love you, Kara Thrace.

267
00:25:59,332 --> 00:26:04,332
Good night.

268
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:30,653
Let me out!

269
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:33,656
Let me out of here!

270
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:37,243
I don't belong here!
Let me out!

271
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:42,244
Let me out!

272
00:26:46,211 --> 00:26:48,505
Racetrack, adjust
your center line 20 degrees.

273
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,048
Snowbird Three,
get in formation.

274
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:52,259
Okay, Snowbirds,
let's nail this exercise.

275
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:53,885
How many times
are we gonna run this thing?

276
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:55,386
<i>What, you're not having fun?</i>

277
00:26:55,387 --> 00:27:00,387
Come on, focus, Snowbirds!

278
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,863
Snowbirds, Galactica.
Regroup into deployment formation

279
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,740
and proceed to position one.

280
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,282
Snowbird One to Snowbirds,

281
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:18,076
drop point in eight seconds.

282
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:21,371
Okay, Snowbirds, let's get
this deployment bang on.

283
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:25,083
The Admiral's
watching every move.

284
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:26,250
Roger, Kat.

285
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:28,252
We go on your command.

286
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:31,214
Bomb bay doors opened.

287
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:36,094
All Vipers break.
Now, now, now!

288
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:37,930
Deploy drones on my mark.

289
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:42,683
Three, two, one, mark!

290
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:45,019
Frak me!

291
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,355
Gods damn it, Snowbird Four,
what the hell happened?

292
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:49,607
Can the chatter, Snowbirds.

293
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:52,193
This is the CAG.
Abort maneuver.

294
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:54,820
I say again, decoy
squadron abort maneuver.

295
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:56,865
Roger that, leader.

296
00:27:56,865 --> 00:28:00,076
Snowbirds, fall back. Abort the drill.
Await further instructions.

297
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:02,287
Frak, they're on my wing.

298
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:04,748
Galactica, Kat.
It is a mess out here.

299
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,750
We've got decoy drones
heading every which way.

300
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,670
Request instructions.

301
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:11,963
Roger that, Kat.
Abort acknowledged.

302
00:28:11,964 --> 00:28:14,799
You're approaching bingo fuel anyway.
Bring your birds back home.

303
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,593
Belay that.

304
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,885
Strike my last. Stand by.

305
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:19,637
Launch the tanker bird.

306
00:28:19,638 --> 00:28:22,766
Let them practice their in-flight
refueling before they recover the drones

307
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:26,103
and run the exercise
one more time.

308
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:31,104
Yes, sir. 16 times now, sir.

309
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:35,820
The next one will
be 17, won't it?

310
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,823
Yes, sir.

311
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:39,950
Launch the tanker.

312
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,742
All units, Galactica.

313
00:28:41,743 --> 00:28:43,744
Recover drones and prepare to
run training mission again.

314
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:45,538
We're launching
the tanker bird.

315
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,164
Tanker? Once you've tanked up,

316
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:50,167
head back to position Alpha and
prepare for training run 17.

317
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:52,336
Galactica out.

318
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:56,008
What the frak
are they doing over there?

319
00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:01,009
This is the Commander.
Get the Admiral on the line.

320
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:03,932
Admiral, considering
how long our pilots

321
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:05,976
have been in the air, I
suggest we recall the birds

322
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,560
and scrub
the training exercise.

323
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:09,313
If we can't do this
in a training scenario,

324
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,397
how the hell are we supposed
to pull this off

325
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:13,692
with Cylon raiders
on our asses?

326
00:29:13,692 --> 00:29:16,361
Huh? Tell me! What the
frak do you want from me?

327
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:18,864
I don't know how we're supposed to do
any of this crap at half strength!

328
00:29:18,865 --> 00:29:21,157
Collision!
We've had a collision!

329
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,366
Give me your status, Kat.

330
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,368
Bingo, Wally, speak to me!

331
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:26,203
I'm losing flight control!

332
00:29:26,204 --> 00:29:28,164
I've got red lights
all across the board!

333
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:31,917
Kat, I'm in a wild spin! I'm losing hydraulics.
My wing is going.

334
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,211
Galactica, Kat.
I'm declaring an emergency.

335
00:29:34,212 --> 00:29:36,464
Request priority landing
for two bent birds.

336
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:38,342
Pull them in! Yes, sir.

337
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,301
Roger that, Kat. Bring
your birds back home.

338
00:29:40,303 --> 00:29:44,722
Further instructions to follow.

339
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:46,892
This whole thing
is frakking insane.

340
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:48,352
We've got two ships
at half strength.

341
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,604
We've got crews that haven't seen
action in a year and a half,

342
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:54,857
and you're acting like the only problem
is they're not working hard enough?

343
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:58,819
Have you taken a look at
yourself in the mirror lately?

344
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,990
You're weak, soft,
mentally and physically.

345
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:04,241
This isn't about me.

346
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:07,703
You've had four months
to get your act together.

347
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:09,998
And so far all you've
been able to frakking do

348
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:12,750
is to complain and whine
about how hard it is.

349
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:15,002
Well, guess what?

350
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:18,089
It's gonna get a lot harder.
Do you understand me?

351
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,425
Now, I want you to turn around and
get your fat ass out of here.

352
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:24,554
Get your men ready,
or I'll find someone who can.

353
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:29,555
Dismissed!

354
00:30:37,693 --> 00:30:39,236
Good shot, Anders.

355
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,905
Go ahead and set it up.

356
00:30:42,906 --> 00:30:46,367
Move inside! Give
me the ball, right here!

357
00:30:46,368 --> 00:30:48,703
I don't like this one, Colonel.

358
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:50,788
I think we're the ones
crossing the line here.

359
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,791
It's the only way it's gonna work.
The kid's got access and clearance.

360
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:56,920
We've got to be square on this. You
can't back out once you've started.

361
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,631
I'm not backing out.

362
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:01,799
It's wrong, Colonel.
You know that, don't you?

363
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,175
He's a soldier, Chief.

364
00:31:03,176 --> 00:31:06,096
It's not the first time we've sent
a soldier on a one-way mission.

365
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:07,346
You know that, don't you?

366
00:31:08,598 --> 00:31:09,807
This is different.

367
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:13,269
This is our best chance
to take out Gaius Baltar.

368
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,522
It may be the only one, and we're
sure as frak gonna take it.

369
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:19,901
Ever since they killed Nora,

370
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:24,902
I've got nothing to live for.

371
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:32,122
Let's go, set it up.

372
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,752
Now look me in the eye and you tell
me that you are committed to this.

373
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:42,753
I'm committed.

374
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:50,761
May the Gods be with you.

375
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,189
Some things you
just don't do, Colonel,

376
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,355
not even in war.

377
00:31:58,356 --> 00:32:03,068
Well, maybe you'll feel different
when you're sitting in detention.

378
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:08,069
Duck volunteered. He's going.

379
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:24,423
It's a hard thing to say,

380
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:28,135
but it seems like I don't
know who my son is anymore.

381
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:32,557
The same goes
for the crew, the ship.

382
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:37,557
I feel pretty much alone.
Except maybe for you.

383
00:32:39,397 --> 00:32:40,731
I wish I could come back a year

384
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:43,192
and tell that Admiral Adama
about this conversation.

385
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:48,193
A year's a long time.

386
00:32:49,075 --> 00:32:54,075
Can I ask you something
very personal?

387
00:32:55,789 --> 00:33:00,789
Do you feel guilty about leaving
the people behind on New Caprica?

388
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:06,336
I don't do guilt.

389
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:11,930
You know, a year ago,

390
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:16,931
when you put me in this cell,
I was at a crossroads.

391
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,566
I sat in here for weeks,
just consumed with rage

392
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:27,567
at all the things
that had happened to me.

393
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:34,243
And at some point I realized
it was all just guilt.

394
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:38,957
I was angry at myself for
the choices I had made.

395
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:43,958
Betraying my people,
losing my baby-

396
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:51,385
So I had a choice.

397
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:55,140
I could either move forward
or stay in the past.

398
00:33:55,141 --> 00:34:00,141
But the only way to move
forward was to forgive myself.

399
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,064
You know, I don't
think we can survive,

400
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:08,065
I don't think the Fleet or Galactica or
the people on New Caprica can survive

401
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:15,655
unless the man at the top finds
a way to forgive himself.

402
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:37,766
Two of our pilots
almost get killed

403
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:40,351
because they've been in
the cockpit for 11 hours,

404
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:44,438
and he wants to bust my balls.

405
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,440
"You're soft."
Can you believe that?

406
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:50,362
What?

407
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:56,367
Oh, you agree, is that it?

408
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:58,827
Forget it.
I'm not looking for a fight.

409
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:00,704
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

410
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:05,126
You got something to say,
come out and say it.

411
00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:09,713
He's right, you are soft.

412
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:12,257
I'm not talking
about the weight.

413
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:17,259
You've lost your edge,
your confidence.

414
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,226
You lost your war, Lee.

415
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:25,271
And the truth is, you're
a soldier who needs a war.

416
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:27,440
And you don't want to hear it
because you've got it in your head

417
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,442
that your father's the soldier,

418
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:32,070
and you sure don't want
to be like him.

419
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,407
But you are like him.

420
00:35:36,409 --> 00:35:39,077
You're more like him
than you know.

421
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:44,077
That's one of the reasons
I married you.

422
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:14,737
Okay, it's working, I think.

423
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,322
Is it working or isn't it?

424
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:19,367
They keep jamming us.

425
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:24,367
So much for our source
on the inside.

426
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:39,344
Ten minutes left. And lots of
nothing on the wireless as usual.

427
00:36:39,346 --> 00:36:41,472
Keep an eye out for Raiders.

428
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:46,474
The last listening bird almost
got popped by a pair yesterday.

429
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:49,355
I've almost got it.

430
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,568
Oh, frak. Turn that thing down.

431
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:59,570
It's working. It's working.

432
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,163
Time's up. Spin up the
FTL, and get ready to go.

433
00:37:05,164 --> 00:37:09,208
Hold on. I'm picking
something up.

434
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,501
It's a Colonial transmission.

435
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:14,255
It's a low power signal, but
the recognition codes match.

436
00:37:14,255 --> 00:37:17,634
Oh, yeah, we've got
a link to the ground.

437
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:20,135
Okay, send the coded response,
spin up the drive,

438
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,931
and let's get the hell
back to Galactica.

439
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:25,307
We've got a signal.

440
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,018
The Raptor just
made contact with us.

441
00:37:27,018 --> 00:37:29,228
What's it say?

442
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,898
"Will make contact this
frequency every twelve hours."

443
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,900
"Prepare sitrep for command authority.
Have hope. We're coming for you."

444
00:37:38,864 --> 00:37:42,867
We made contact! I say
again, we made contact with the ground.

445
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,786
Colonel Tigh has formed an insurgent
group against the Cylons,

446
00:37:45,788 --> 00:37:47,246
and now they're
ready and waiting

447
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:52,248
for instructions on how to
coordinate the rescue effort.

448
00:37:53,711 --> 00:37:58,711
It's gonna be okay.
It's really gonna be okay.

449
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:20,822
These are the surveillance
pictures taken by the insurgents.

450
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:24,617
I think we can match names
to about 50 of these photos,

451
00:38:24,617 --> 00:38:28,246
but our best guess puts the total
police force at around 200.

452
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:31,206
Two hundred.

453
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,916
I wouldn't have believed
there'd be 20 people

454
00:38:32,918 --> 00:38:34,960
who would turn
against their own kind.

455
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:37,755
I want those names. I want
the rest of the names.

456
00:38:37,755 --> 00:38:41,925
That's tough. The Cylons are afraid the
population will go after any human

457
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:43,344
who joins
the New Caprica Police.

458
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:48,344
As well they should.

459
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:09,036
I know I haven't lived
a model life.

460
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:14,038
I made a lot of mistakes.

461
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:19,793
I'm gonna need
your protection today.

462
00:39:22,175 --> 00:39:23,300
Mr. President?

463
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:25,302
Good morning, Gaeta.

464
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:30,304
It's time for
the graduation ceremony.

465
00:39:31,476 --> 00:39:36,476
Oh, yes, the ceremony.

466
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:40,818
About the ceremony.
There's been a change of plan.

467
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:44,280
I won't be going.

468
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,280
Security concern.

469
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,581
Don't look so worried.

470
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:57,668
There'll be other graduations.

471
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,670
Right. Okay. I'll just
let the staff know.

472
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:12,516
I think we should
call off the strike.

473
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:15,394
There's no reason to go forward if
the Galactica's gonna come back.

474
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:19,690
What, pass up a golden opportunity
to kill Gaius Baltar?

475
00:40:19,692 --> 00:40:21,608
Other than that, Colonel,
I fail to see the point.

476
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,527
Think with your head, Chief,
not with your heart.

477
00:40:23,528 --> 00:40:26,114
The only way they stand a chance
of getting us off this rock

478
00:40:26,114 --> 00:40:28,574
is if the Cylons are
too distracted battling

479
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:32,744
a full-blown uprising
when they get here.

480
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:36,873
All right. If your source on the inside
says Baltar's not gonna be there, abort.

481
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:41,875
Otherwise, stick with the plan.

482
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:13,077
Hormonal
imbalances or neurological disorders.

483
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:15,746
But many have found relief at
the New Caprica medical center

484
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:20,748
where a crack team of human
and Cylon physicians...

485
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:39,329
Hey, Duck.

486
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:39,875
Fall in!

487
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:03,728
Good morning and welcome
to all graduates.

488
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:06,315
You are the hope.

489
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:11,112
You are the dream of a new tomorrow
for humans and Cylon alike.

490
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:16,112
And I salute you for the risks that you
have taken for just showing up today.

491
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,746
Today you begin a new career

492
00:43:20,746 --> 00:43:24,333
and a new life as
provisional police officers.

493
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,710
And looking out
across this room,

494
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,710
I see the significance of this
new path is not lost on you.

495
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:39,764
Congratulations.
It's good to have you with us.

496
00:43:39,766 --> 00:43:44,766
Congratulations, Sergeant.
A dangerous mission.

497
00:43:50,152 --> 00:43:53,695
Congratulations, Captain. It's
great to have you with us.

498
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:58,697
I'll see you soon, Nora.
