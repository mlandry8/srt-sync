1
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:25,481
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:29,067
We haven't been properly
introduced. I'm Leoben.

3
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:31,695
I'm looking forward to spending a
little more time with you, Starbuck.

4
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:32,905
We have a lot to talk about!

5
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:34,948
It's gonna be fun.

6
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:36,992
Congratulations, Commander.

7
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:41,330
The Pegasus is your command.

8
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:44,750
Hey, I am picking up
a large planetary body.

9
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:49,129
It's habitable. We may have just found
a world that can support human life.

10
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,507
I know in my gut that
settling on this planet's

11
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:53,383
gonna mean disaster
for humanity,

12
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:56,094
and I will not say otherwise
just to win an election.

13
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:59,056
I take the office of President
of the 12 Colonies of Kobol.

14
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:01,475
And I am going to sign
my first executive order

15
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:04,061
requiring to immediately
establish settlements

16
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:08,273
on the planet we have come
to know as New Caprica.

17
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:10,734
If you want to move down
there, go ahead, be my guest.

18
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:13,111
Go down and cat around
with all the men.

19
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:15,531
Saul, I want you.

20
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:20,532
At last, a safe haven
we can call home.

21
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:25,082
Oh, my Gods!

22
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:27,918
The Cylon fleet, they found us.

23
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:29,336
We have to get out
of here, sir.

24
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:31,630
We can't just leave
all those people behind.

25
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:32,756
There's nothing we can do.

26
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:34,758
We're in no shape
for a fight, sir.

27
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,134
They'll be wiped out.

28
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:37,386
We don't have a choice.

29
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:39,638
We need to get out
of here right now!

30
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:43,267
Begin jump prep. We're leaving.

31
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:44,393
But we'll be back.

32
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:46,144
The Cylons just
jumped into orbit.

33
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:49,523
And the fleet's jumped away.
They've left us.

34
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:54,152
On behalf of the
people of the 12 Colonies,

35
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:56,405
I surrender.

36
00:01:56,406 --> 00:02:01,406
I'm looking for Kara Thrace.

37
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:13,514
Do you know that every time
they take you out of this cell,

38
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:17,522
we come in here and we change
those little hashmarks

39
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:20,025
on your little calendar there
you're trying to hide?

40
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:30,531
Potatoes, gravy,
even some carrots.

41
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:57,062
Heavenly Father, we thank you
for the bounty of this table.

42
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:58,438
Yes.

43
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:01,900
Yes.

44
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:04,194
Come on, don't stop.

45
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:08,740
Come on, come on,
you son of a bitch!

46
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:10,492
You son of a bitch!

47
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:14,329
Oh, yeah.

48
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,426
Oh, boy.

49
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:41,064
All right, we're armed.

50
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:46,065
They're inbound. Let's move!

51
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:11,215
I need a knife.

52
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:30,697
Thank you.

53
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:35,698
You're welcome.

54
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:46,129
I must say,
I quite enjoyed that.

55
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:51,130
I'm so glad.

56
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,930
And when do I get what I want?

57
00:07:56,223 --> 00:08:00,685
I believe that's happening
right now.

58
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:13,031
We reviewed your case today,

59
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:18,032
and I must say there was great
disappointment on the review committee.

60
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:48,358
Come on.

61
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:51,236
We've got to get you processed.
It'll take an hour or so.

62
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:54,030
Bureaucracy must be served.

63
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:56,700
But if you're lucky, you'll
get home by dinnertime.

64
00:08:56,701 --> 00:09:01,204
Colonel, come on.

65
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:06,205
I'm not gonna hold
this door open forever.

66
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,221
Attention, New Capricans.
Effective immediately, a pot of water

67
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:21,975
will be given to residents in
even-numbered pods on even-numbered days

68
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:26,976
and odd-numbered pods on odd-numbered days.
Rationing will be...

69
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:28,565
Saul!

70
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,033
Oh, sweetheart.
What did they do to you?

71
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:43,034
It's all right. I'm out,
and that's all that matters.

72
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,380
Come on, now,
let's get out of here.

73
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:52,881
Okay.

74
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:15,191
Okay, ready? Now!

75
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:19,157
Oh, for frak sakes.
Come on! Come on!

76
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:24,158
Is that thing gonna work
or what?

77
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:32,458
It worked that time.
Come on. Go, go!

78
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:40,508
Frakking insurgents.

79
00:10:59,573 --> 00:11:04,573
You look so lovely tonight.

80
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:40,609
I'll see you soon, Kara.

81
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:44,909
Take your time.

82
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:13,957
"One hundred

"on a day when it feels
like perpetual war

87

a high-profile target.

97

Cylons, because they don't die.

they continue to walk among us.

99
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,058

and we remain at their mercy."

102
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:26,029
"The Colonial Government,
under President Gaius Baltar,"

103
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,240
"functions in name only."

104
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:32,285
Let's review why we're here,
shall we?

105
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:35,913
We're supposed to bring the word
of God to the people, right?

106
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:38,207
To save humanity from damnation

107
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,252
by bringing the love of God to
these poor benighted people.

108
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:43,212
We're here because
the majority of the Cylon

109
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:46,215
felt that the slaughter of
mankind had been a mistake.

110
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:48,384
We're here to find a new
way to live in peace,

111
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:49,927
as God wants us to live.

112
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:51,721
And it's been a fun ride
so far.

113
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:54,265
But I want to clarify
our objectives.

114
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,683
If we're bringing
the word of God,

115
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:56,976
then it follows

116
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:59,812
that we should employ any
means necessary to do so.

117
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:01,189
Any means. Yes.

118
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,317
Fear is a key article
of faith, as I understand it.

119
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:07,278
So perhaps it's time to
instill a little more fear

120
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,323
into the people's
hearts and minds.

121
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:14,452
Let's execute Baltar.

122
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:18,998
What, what?

123
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,208
That's not gonna happen.

124
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:22,043
Just because
he's your favorite toy

125
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:24,962
shouldn't be allowed to interfere
with the larger issues here.

126
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:26,547
I think that
I have cooperated...

127
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,383
Gaius is with me.

128
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:32,303
Anyone who wants to challenge
that will have to deal with me.

129
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:33,596
No, it doesn't matter.

130
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:36,015
If we'd killed him at the
beginning, it might have worked.

131
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:37,934
But now most humans
think of him as a traitor

132
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:39,394
and would actually
cheer his death.

133
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:42,605
Fine, fine.
We don't kill Baltar.

134
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:46,734
We round up the leaders of the insurgency,
and we execute them publicly.

135
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,945
We round up, at random,
groups off the street,

136
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,822
and we execute them publicly.

137
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:53,699
Send a message that the
gloves are coming off.

138
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,412
The insurgency stops now or else we
start reducing the human population

139
00:15:57,413 --> 00:16:00,331
to a more manageable size.

140
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:02,792
I don't know,
say less than 1,000.

141
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:04,335
We need to stop being butchers.

142
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:08,923
The entire point of coming here
was to start a new way of life,

143
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:12,593
to push past the conflict that
separated us from humans for so long.

144
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:14,429
And what has it gotten us?

145
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,432
It's not like
they welcomed us with...

146
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:21,185
Oh, frak it, never mind. You're
all living in a fantasy world.

147
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:22,645
Consider the irony in that!

148
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,440
Delusional machines.

149
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:30,441
What's the universe
gonna come up with next?

150
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,285
Is it really worth it, Caprica?

151
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:41,372
Is the love of that man really
worth possibly losing all of this?

152
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:43,624
If you ever experienced love,

153
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:48,625
you wouldn't have to ask.

154
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:56,888
"In recent months, the Cylons
have been recruiting and training humans

155

a human police force.

156

"Led to believe they were merely
taking the civilian security

159
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:15,072
"out of the hands
of the Cylons,

160
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:16,616
"the members
of the human police

161
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:21,287
"have since become an extension of
the Cylons' corporeal authority.

162
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:24,332
"And while their names
are kept deeply confidential,"

163
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:29,333
"there's no question some of them
are people we might least expect."

164
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:34,509
”Hundreds of us have been
rounded up by the Cylons,

165
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,596
"held in detention,
questioned, tortured.

166
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:42,433
"Others have simply vanished.

167
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:44,268
"In recent weeks,

168
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:48,022
"we've been gaining access to
some very important documents

169
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:52,610
"from a source within
Baltar's administration.

170
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:56,531
"No one knows who this
mysterious benefactor is,

171
00:17:56,532 --> 00:18:01,532
"but he communicates with the
insurgents by means of a secret signal.

172
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:05,831
"We pray every day for the men
and women who risk their lives"

173
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:07,124
"to fight the Cylons."

174
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:12,125
"They have everything to lose and such
little hope of something to gain."

175
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:19,007
Hey, Jake.

176
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:53,838
There we go.

177
00:18:56,091 --> 00:19:00,344
It looks like Mommy's gonna get
some sleep tonight after all.

178
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:09,478
You know, sometimes I hate
everything about this place.

179
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:14,479
But sometimes it's magic.

180
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:25,532
I gotta go. Be back
in a couple hours.

181
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:33,628
One of these days you're just
not gonna come back, are you?

182
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:36,714
You'll just vanish,
and that'll be it.

183
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:39,717
I'll never see you again.

184
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:44,718
Nick will never know
his father.

185
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:52,184
A couple hours, promise.

186
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:37,525
Good to see you, Colonel.

187
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:42,526
It's good to be seen.

188
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:50,538
I know you're wondering,
so I'll save you the trouble.

189
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,665
The eye is gone.

190
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,500
Ripped it right out,
onto the floor,

191
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:57,044
picked it up
and showed it to me.

192
00:20:57,045 --> 00:21:02,045
It looked like
a hardboiled egg.

193
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:07,513
Big boom today.

194
00:21:07,514 --> 00:21:08,639
Hope that was you two.

195
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,142
Oh, yeah. A heavy Raider, too.

196
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:14,186
Good man.
What's our next target?

197
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:16,063
Well, we got these today.

198
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:17,940
They're security plans
for the graduation ceremony

199
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:20,317
of the New Caprica
Police Academy.

200
00:21:20,318 --> 00:21:22,153
These are right out
of the Ministry files.

201
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:23,279
Where are you getting
this stuff?

202
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,613
Who's your source?

203
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:28,033
I have no idea. The source won't
tell me what their name is.

204
00:21:28,034 --> 00:21:29,827
It's probably safer
for all of us.

205
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:31,662
We've been getting
stuff like this for weeks.

206
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:35,040
Humans working for the Cylons,
makes me wanna puke.

207
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,335
Yeah, well, all of the top Occupation
brass is gonna be at the graduation,

208
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:41,422
even President Baltar.

209
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:42,798
Gaius Baltar?

210
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,883
Yes, sir.

211
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:45,342
I think we can get
a shot at him, too.

212
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:47,803
The problem is, it's gonna be
tough avoiding human casualties.

213
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:50,181
Don't avoid them!
Send a message.

214
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:52,516
You work with the Cylons,
you're a target.

215
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:55,770
No boundaries for the Cylons,
there's no boundaries for us!

216
00:21:55,771 --> 00:22:00,771
Anything we can do to nail that son of
a bitch, Gaius Baltar, is worth doing.

217
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:09,700
Where are we on the wireless?

218
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:13,078
Nowhere. Every day we try
and contact the Raptor,

219
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:16,290
and every day the Cylons
jam the transmission.

220
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,292
I've asked the inside source
to tell us

221
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,586
which of the Cylon jamming
frequencies are the weakest,

222
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:21,962
but so far I've got nothing.

223
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:26,383
You guys are dreaming. There's
no Raptor there, okay?

224
00:22:26,384 --> 00:22:29,970
There hasn't been one for the
past four months, either.

225
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:33,933
Galactica's not coming back.
They're not.

226
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:37,144
Accept it. You watch
your frakking mouth!

227
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:40,481
There's a Raptor out there every day,
listening for our wireless call.

228
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:44,026
It's out there because that was
the plan if anything happened.

229
00:22:44,027 --> 00:22:48,364
And it's out there because the old man
isn't just gonna leave us to the Cylons!

230
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:51,450
The old man left me
to the Cylons, Colonel.

231
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:54,578
And if it wasn't for my wife
being a royal pain in the ass

232
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:55,955
and refusing to let it go,

233
00:22:55,956 --> 00:23:00,956
I would be dead a year now.

234
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:13,013
Any word on Kara?

235
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:18,014
Nothing in four months.

236
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:36,787
Hi, honey. I'm home.

237
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:45,170
You kill me, I download,

238
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:48,674
I come back, we start over.

239
00:23:48,675 --> 00:23:53,675
Five times now.

240
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:08,736
I'm trying to help you, Kara.

241
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:11,822
I only want you to see
the truth of your life,

242
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:14,617
the reason why you suffered and
you struggled for so long.

243
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:16,327
That's why God sent me to you.

244
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:20,539
That's why God wants us
to be together.

245
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,710
You're right.

246
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:27,129
You're right.

247
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,672
And I hear you. I do.

248
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:31,383
Okay.

249
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:36,384
So, thank you.

250
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:44,271
Thank you
for putting up with me.

251
00:24:44,272 --> 00:24:45,356
I'm so sorry.

252
00:24:45,357 --> 00:24:50,357
Put it down, Kara.

253
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:57,155
Just put it down.

254
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:03,832
I'm a patient man.

255
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,042
You're not a man.

256
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:07,711
I'm willing to wait.
You just need more time.

257
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:11,757
I don't need more frakking time.
It's never gonna happen.

258
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:14,510
Of course it's gonna happen.
You're gonna hold me in your arms.

259
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:18,722
You're gonna embrace me. You're
gonna tell me that you love me.

260
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:21,934
I've seen it.

261
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:23,769
You're insane.

262
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:28,770
To know the face of God
is to know madness.

263
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:36,699
I'm going to bed.

264
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,700
Be nice if you joined me.

265
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Either way, you're spending
the night with me.

266
00:25:56,553 --> 00:26:00,931
I do love you, Kara Thrace.

267
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:05,932
Good night.

268
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,254
Let me out!

269
00:26:32,255 --> 00:26:35,257
Let me out of here!

270
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:38,844
I don't belong here!
Let me out!

271
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:43,845
Let me out!

272
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:50,105
Racetrack, adjust
your center line 20 degrees.

273
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:51,648
Snowbird Three,
get in formation.

274
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:53,859
Okay, Snowbirds,
let's nail this exercise.

275
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,486
How many times
are we gonna run this thing?

276
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:56,987
<i>What, you're not having fun?</i>

277
00:26:56,988 --> 00:27:01,988
Come on, focus, Snowbirds!

278
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,463
Snowbirds, Galactica.
Regroup into deployment formation

279
00:27:14,464 --> 00:27:16,340
and proceed to position one.

280
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:17,883
Snowbird One to Snowbirds,

281
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:19,676
drop point in eight seconds.

282
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:22,971
Okay, Snowbirds, let's get
this deployment bang on.

283
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:26,683
The Admiral's
watching every move.

284
00:27:26,684 --> 00:27:27,851
Roger, Kat.

285
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:29,853
We go on your command.

286
00:27:29,854 --> 00:27:32,815
Bomb bay doors opened.

287
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:37,694
All Vipers break.
Now, now, now!

288
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,530
Deploy drones on my mark.

289
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:44,284
Three, two, one, mark!

290
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,620
Frak me!

291
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:48,956
Gods damn it, Snowbird Four,
what the hell happened?

292
00:27:48,957 --> 00:27:51,208
Can the chatter, Snowbirds.

293
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:53,794
This is the CAG.
Abort maneuver.

294
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:56,421
I say again, decoy
squadron abort maneuver.

295
00:27:56,422 --> 00:27:58,465
Roger that, leader.

296
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:01,677
Snowbirds, fall back. Abort the drill.
Await further instructions.

297
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:03,887
Frak, they're on my wing.

298
00:28:03,888 --> 00:28:06,348
Galactica, Kat.
It is a mess out here.

299
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:08,350
We've got decoy drones
heading every which way.

300
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:11,270
Request instructions.

301
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:13,564
Roger that, Kat.
Abort acknowledged.

302
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:16,400
You're approaching bingo fuel anyway.
Bring your birds back home.

303
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:18,193
Belay that.

304
00:28:18,194 --> 00:28:19,486
Strike my last. Stand by.

305
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,238
Launch the tanker bird.

306
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:24,366
Let them practice their in-flight
refueling before they recover the drones

307
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,703
and run the exercise
one more time.

308
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:32,704
Yes, sir. 16 times now, sir.

309
00:28:34,627 --> 00:28:37,421
The next one will
be 17, won't it?

310
00:28:37,422 --> 00:28:39,423
Yes, sir.

311
00:28:39,424 --> 00:28:41,550
Launch the tanker.

312
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:43,343
All units, Galactica.

313
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:45,345
Recover drones and prepare to
run training mission again.

314
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:47,139
We're launching
the tanker bird.

315
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,765
Tanker? Once you've tanked up,

316
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:51,768
head back to position Alpha and
prepare for training run 17.

317
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,937
Galactica out.

318
00:28:53,938 --> 00:28:57,608
What the frak
are they doing over there?

319
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:02,609
This is the Commander.
Get the Admiral on the line.

320
00:29:03,615 --> 00:29:05,532
Admiral, considering
how long our pilots

321
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,576
have been in the air, I
suggest we recall the birds

322
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:09,161
and scrub
the training exercise.

323
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:10,913
If we can't do this
in a training scenario,

324
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:12,998
how the hell are we supposed
to pull this off

325
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:15,292
with Cylon raiders
on our asses?

326
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:17,961
Huh? Tell me! What the
frak do you want from me?

327
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,464
I don't know how we're supposed to do
any of this crap at half strength!

328
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:22,758
Collision!
We've had a collision!

329
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:23,967
Give me your status, Kat.

330
00:29:23,968 --> 00:29:25,969
Bingo, Wally, speak to me!

331
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,804
I'm losing flight control!

332
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:29,765
I've got red lights
all across the board!

333
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:33,518
Kat, I'm in a wild spin! I'm losing hydraulics.
My wing is going.

334
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,812
Galactica, Kat.
I'm declaring an emergency.

335
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:38,065
Request priority landing
for two bent birds.

336
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:39,942
Pull them in! Yes, sir.

337
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:41,902
Roger that, Kat. Bring
your birds back home.

338
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:46,323
Further instructions to follow.

339
00:29:46,324 --> 00:29:48,492
This whole thing
is frakking insane.

340
00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:49,952
We've got two ships
at half strength.

341
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:52,204
We've got crews that haven't seen
action in a year and a half,

342
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:56,458
and you're acting like the only problem
is they're not working hard enough?

343
00:29:56,459 --> 00:30:00,420
Have you taken a look at
yourself in the mirror lately?

344
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:04,591
You're weak, soft,
mentally and physically.

345
00:30:04,592 --> 00:30:05,842
This isn't about me.

346
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:09,304
You've had four months
to get your act together.

347
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:11,598
And so far all you've
been able to frakking do

348
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,351
is to complain and whine
about how hard it is.

349
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:16,603
Well, guess what?

350
00:30:16,604 --> 00:30:19,690
It's gonna get a lot harder.
Do you understand me?

351
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:23,026
Now, I want you to turn around and
get your fat ass out of here.

352
00:30:23,027 --> 00:30:26,154
Get your men ready,
or I'll find someone who can.

353
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:31,155
Dismissed!

354
00:30:39,294 --> 00:30:40,836
Good shot, Anders.

355
00:30:40,837 --> 00:30:44,506
Go ahead and set it up.

356
00:30:44,507 --> 00:30:47,968
Move inside! Give
me the ball, right here!

357
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:50,304
I don't like this one, Colonel.

358
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:52,389
I think we're the ones
crossing the line here.

359
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,392
It's the only way it's gonna work.
The kid's got access and clearance.

360
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:58,520
We've got to be square on this. You
can't back out once you've started.

361
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:01,231
I'm not backing out.

362
00:31:01,232 --> 00:31:03,400
It's wrong, Colonel.
You know that, don't you?

363
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:04,776
He's a soldier, Chief.

364
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:07,696
It's not the first time we've sent
a soldier on a one-way mission.

365
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:08,947
You know that, don't you?

366
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,408
This is different.

367
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:14,870
This is our best chance
to take out Gaius Baltar.

368
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:18,123
It may be the only one, and we're
sure as frak gonna take it.

369
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:21,501
Ever since they killed Nora,

370
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:26,502
I've got nothing to live for.

371
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,722
Let's go, set it up.

372
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,353
Now look me in the eye and you tell
me that you are committed to this.

373
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:44,354
I'm committed.

374
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:52,362
May the Gods be with you.

375
00:31:56,371 --> 00:31:58,789
Some things you
just don't do, Colonel,

376
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,956
not even in war.

377
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:04,669
Well, maybe you'll feel different
when you're sitting in detention.

378
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,670
Duck volunteered. He's going.

379
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:26,024
It's a hard thing to say,

380
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:29,736
but it seems like I don't
know who my son is anymore.

381
00:32:29,737 --> 00:32:34,157
The same goes
for the crew, the ship.

382
00:32:34,158 --> 00:32:39,158
I feel pretty much alone.
Except maybe for you.

383
00:32:40,998 --> 00:32:42,332
I wish I could come back a year

384
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,793
and tell that Admiral Adama
about this conversation.

385
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:49,794
A year's a long time.

386
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:55,675
Can I ask you something
very personal?

387
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:02,390
Do you feel guilty about leaving
the people behind on New Caprica?

388
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:07,937
I don't do guilt.

389
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,530
You know, a year ago,

390
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:18,531
when you put me in this cell,
I was at a crossroads.

391
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:24,166
I sat in here for weeks,
just consumed with rage

392
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:29,167
at all the things
that had happened to me.

393
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:35,844
And at some point I realized
it was all just guilt.

394
00:33:35,845 --> 00:33:40,557
I was angry at myself for
the choices I had made.

395
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:45,558
Betraying my people,
losing my baby-

396
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:52,986
So I had a choice.

397
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:56,740
I could either move forward
or stay in the past.

398
00:33:56,741 --> 00:34:01,741
But the only way to move
forward was to forgive myself.

399
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,664
You know, I don't
think we can survive,

400
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:09,665
I don't think the Fleet or Galactica or
the people on New Caprica can survive

401
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:17,256
unless the man at the top finds
a way to forgive himself.

402
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:39,366
Two of our pilots
almost get killed

403
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:41,952
because they've been in
the cockpit for 11 hours,

404
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:46,039
and he wants to bust my balls.

405
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,040
"You're soft."
Can you believe that?

406
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:51,962
What?

407
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:57,968
Oh, you agree, is that it?

408
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:00,428
Forget it.
I'm not looking for a fight.

409
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:02,305
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

410
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:06,726
You got something to say,
come out and say it.

411
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:11,314
He's right, you are soft.

412
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:13,858
I'm not talking
about the weight.

413
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,859
You've lost your edge,
your confidence.

414
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:22,826
You lost your war, Lee.

415
00:35:22,827 --> 00:35:26,871
And the truth is, you're
a soldier who needs a war.

416
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:29,040
And you don't want to hear it
because you've got it in your head

417
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,042
that your father's the soldier,

418
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,670
and you sure don't want
to be like him.

419
00:35:33,671 --> 00:35:38,008
But you are like him.

420
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:40,677
You're more like him
than you know.

421
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:45,678
That's one of the reasons
I married you.

422
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:16,338
Okay, it's working, I think.

423
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,923
Is it working or isn't it?

424
00:36:18,924 --> 00:36:20,967
They keep jamming us.

425
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:25,968
So much for our source
on the inside.

426
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:40,945
Ten minutes left. And lots of
nothing on the wireless as usual.

427
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:43,073
Keep an eye out for Raiders.

428
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:48,074
The last listening bird almost
got popped by a pair yesterday.

429
00:36:48,996 --> 00:36:50,955
I've almost got it.

430
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,169
Oh, frak. Turn that thing down.

431
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,170
It's working. It's working.

432
00:37:03,886 --> 00:37:06,763
Time's up. Spin up the
FTL, and get ready to go.

433
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:10,809
Hold on. I'm picking
something up.

434
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,102
It's a Colonial transmission.

435
00:37:12,103 --> 00:37:15,855
It's a low power signal, but
the recognition codes match.

436
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:19,234
Oh, yeah, we've got
a link to the ground.

437
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:21,736
Okay, send the coded response,
spin up the drive,

438
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:24,531
and let's get the hell
back to Galactica.

439
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:26,908
We've got a signal.

440
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:28,618
The Raptor just
made contact with us.

441
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,829
What's it say?

442
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,499
"Will make contact this
frequency every twelve hours."

443
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,500
"Prepare sitrep for command authority.
Have hope. We're coming for you."

444
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:44,467
We made contact! I say
again, we made contact with the ground.

445
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:47,387
Colonel Tigh has formed an insurgent
group against the Cylons,

446
00:37:47,388 --> 00:37:48,847
and now they're
ready and waiting

447
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:53,848
for instructions on how to
coordinate the rescue effort.

448
00:37:55,312 --> 00:38:00,312
It's gonna be okay.
It's really gonna be okay.

449
00:38:19,378 --> 00:38:22,422
These are the surveillance
pictures taken by the insurgents.

450
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:26,217
I think we can match names
to about 50 of these photos,

451
00:38:26,218 --> 00:38:29,846
but our best guess puts the total
police force at around 200.

452
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:32,807
Two hundred.

453
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:34,517
I wouldn't have believed
there'd be 20 people

454
00:38:34,518 --> 00:38:36,561
who would turn
against their own kind.

455
00:38:36,562 --> 00:38:39,355
I want those names. I want
the rest of the names.

456
00:38:39,356 --> 00:38:43,526
That's tough. The Cylons are afraid the
population will go after any human

457
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:44,944
who joins
the New Caprica Police.

458
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:49,945
As well they should.

459
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:10,637
I know I haven't lived
a model life.

460
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:15,638
I made a lot of mistakes.

461
00:39:16,393 --> 00:39:21,393
I'm gonna need
your protection today.

462
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:24,901
Mr. President?

463
00:39:24,902 --> 00:39:26,903
Good morning, Gaeta.

464
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:31,904
It's time for
the graduation ceremony.

465
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:38,077
Oh, yes, the ceremony.

466
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:42,418
About the ceremony.
There's been a change of plan.

467
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:45,880
I won't be going.

468
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:50,881
Security concern.

469
00:39:54,098 --> 00:39:56,182
Don't look so worried.

470
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:59,269
There'll be other graduations.

471
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:04,270
Right. Okay. I'll just
let the staff know.

472
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:14,117
I think we should
call off the strike.

473
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:16,995
There's no reason to go forward if
the Galactica's gonna come back.

474
00:40:16,996 --> 00:40:21,291
What, pass up a golden opportunity
to kill Gaius Baltar?

475
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:23,209
Other than that, Colonel,
I fail to see the point.

476
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,128
Think with your head, Chief,
not with your heart.

477
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:27,714
The only way they stand a chance
of getting us off this rock

478
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:30,174
is if the Cylons are
too distracted battling

479
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:34,345
a full-blown uprising
when they get here.

480
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:38,474
All right. If your source on the inside
says Baltar's not gonna be there, abort.

481
00:40:38,475 --> 00:40:43,475
Otherwise, stick with the plan.

482
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,677
Hormonal
imbalances or neurological disorders.

483
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:17,347
But many have found relief at
the New Caprica medical center

484
00:41:17,348 --> 00:41:22,348
where a crack team of human
and Cylon physicians...

485
00:42:37,594 --> 00:42:40,930
Hey, Duck.

486
00:42:40,931 --> 00:42:41,475
Fall in!

487
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:05,329
Good morning and welcome
to all graduates.

488
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,915
You are the hope.

489
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:12,712
You are the dream of a new tomorrow
for humans and Cylon alike.

490
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:17,713
And I salute you for the risks that you
have taken for just showing up today.

491
00:43:19,261 --> 00:43:22,346
Today you begin a new career

492
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:25,933
and a new life as
provisional police officers.

493
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:27,310
And looking out
across this room,

494
00:43:27,311 --> 00:43:32,311
I see the significance of this
new path is not lost on you.

495
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:41,365
Congratulations.
It's good to have you with us.

496
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:46,366
Congratulations, Sergeant.
A dangerous mission.

497
00:43:51,752 --> 00:43:55,296
Congratulations, Captain. It's
great to have you with us.

498
00:43:55,297 --> 00:44:00,297
I'll see you soon, Nora.
